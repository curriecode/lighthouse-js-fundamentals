/*Another common structure for looping in JavaScript is the for loop. 
The idea of a for loop is very similar to a while, 
only all the code that relates to the state of the loop is written on one line.*/

const chorus = "Let's dance!";
for (let repeat = 0; repeat < 10; repeat++) {
  console.log(chorus);
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");

/*This new chorus program produced the same result as our first program in this exercise. 
But as we can see, our counter variable, repeat, 
our condition that should be true for our loop to continue, 
and the incrementing of our counter variable, are all written in one line.*/
