} else if (temperature < 15) {
  console.log("Short sleeves won't cut it!");

//example 2

const isCitizen = true;

  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}

//example 3

if (temperature < -40 || temperature > 40) {
  console.log("Maybe going outside isn't such a great ideaâ€¦");
}

// Here our if statement is true when temperature is either below -40 or above 40 degrees.


// example 4

if (!raining) {
  console.log("Leave your umbrella at home!");
}

/*We read the expression in the above example usually as "if not raining", 
but it's not always intuitive what "not true" or "not false" mean unless you 
remember that the ! operator reverses the value of raining. That is, if raining is true, 
!raining is false. If raining is false, !raining is true.*/
